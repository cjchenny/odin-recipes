    <ol>
        <li>Place a large pot of lightly salted water (no more than 1 
            tablespoon salt) over high heat, and bring to a boil. 
            Fill a large bowl with hot water for serving, and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, yolks and pecorino 
            and Parmesan. Season with a pinch of salt and generous black pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Set the water to boil. Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat, 
            add the pork, and saut√© until the fat just renders, 
            on the edge of crispness but not hard. Remove from heat 
            and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add pasta to the water and boil until a bit firmer than al dente. Just 
            before pasta is ready, reheat guanciale in skillet, if needed. Reserve 1 
            cup of pasta water, then drain pasta and add to the skillet over low heat.
             Stir for a minute or so.</li>
        <li>Empty serving bowl of hot water. Dry it and add hot pasta mixture. Stir 
            in cheese mixture, adding some reserved pasta water if needed for creaminess. 
            Serve immediately,dressing it with a bit of additional grated pecorino 
            and pepper.</li>
